CPSC 581 Project by Nathan Lum, Victor Dong, Parker Smith, and Michaela Gilchrist

A project focused on making new ways to unlock your phone 

Our Lucky 7s lock screen works much like the scratch and win lottery where you need to scratch off three 7s in a row, horizontal, vertical, or diagonal. 
Though the difference between this and an actual scratch and win ticket is that there is guaranteed to be three sevens in a row, you just have to find them. 
The row the 7s will be in is selected randomly and all other numbers in the grid are random numbers between 0 and 9, not including 7. 
The screen unlocks when you scratch a third 7.  For Lucky 7s you have to separately scratch off three 7s in a row, so an accidental activation is unlikely.
